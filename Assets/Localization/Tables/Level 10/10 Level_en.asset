    m_Localized: We are in a voltage regulator. It's a pretty gray and dingy place,
      so I don't like it much. Since there's a lot of power here, it means the anti-virus
      is stronger, so maybe there are some uninfected personnel left here (the author
      says if you see something that looks like a frog here, ignore it)

      a control panel or activating a pressure plate. In some cases, it is necessary
      to get rid of employees (even uninfected ones) so that they do not block the
      gate with their energy fields... '

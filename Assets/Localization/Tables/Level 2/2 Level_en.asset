    m_Localized: This is the second level, so it's pretty simple. There are only
      a couple enemies and no infestation, good luck!

  - m_Id: 92706549760
    m_Localized: On the floors you may encounter different paths to the exit. To
      open new paths, try to charge the button with energy from the cube to see if
      it activates something....
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 148486598656
    m_Localized: You can also use the cubes and buttons to move platforms and then
      use them to climb to previously inaccessible places. The cube will not be destroyed
      if it comes in contact with an enemy.... I guess...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 170116624384
    m_Localized: Some buttons can remove viral spikes and growths. This will help
      you get to places you couldn't get to before due to infection.  Also, some
      levels require you to charge the output before using it (not all levels)

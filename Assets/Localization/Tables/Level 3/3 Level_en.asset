    m_Localized: This is the third floor. This is where you will first become familiar
      with the control panels. You will be able to control some of the system's processes.
      Perhaps you can use them for your own purposes...

    m_Localized: This is our forklift. Now he seems to be infected. I do not advise
      contacting him, his strength is higher than that of mail bots. Although if
      you want to remove it, you will have to strike a few blows...

      click on it, so to find out what it controls, you'll have to try (press F to
      interact)

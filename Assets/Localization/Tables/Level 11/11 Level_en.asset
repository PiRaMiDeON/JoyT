  - m_Id: 8803692544
    m_Localized: this is the eleventh floor - a place of incineration of technical
      waste, for example, infected data, personnel... I'm kidding, it's not data.
      We need to visit a friend. Its destruction is one of the steps to stop the
      spread of the virus

      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 732644093952
    m_Localized: So, now you need to go upstairs and activate the main panel!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 796565286912
    m_Localized: Okay, there are two more left
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 806707113984
    m_Localized: Before dumping waste, it is necessary to open the security gateways.
      If not all of them are opened, then you will not be able to access the activation
      panel of the incineration procedure
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 817603915776
    m_Localized: The main gate is open, there are three more left - go ahead!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 827263397888
    m_Localized: Now this flame power should be enough. It's time to start opening
      the gates!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 836998377472
    m_Localized: Great, the flame is starting to flare up. We need to activate a
      couple more panels!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 846041296896
    m_Localized: In order to be able to burn infected waste, it is necessary that
      there is a high flame temperature. To do this, you will have to strengthen
      the flame with the help of control panels
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 855587532800
    m_Localized: Okay, now we can go to the left side of the complex. There we will
      be able to find the remaining panels and go outside to then get to the main
      panel
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 865096019968
    m_Localized: That should get you to the second control panel. The doors at the
      entrance to the room should have opened

      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 877045592064
    m_Localized: Great, now he's finally finished- he's no longer a threat. We need
      to go to the final floor we have important business there

  - m_Id: 27925524480
    m_Localized: Sixth floor. Here, special fields are used to transmit energy throughout
      the system, through which personnel can also move. At the edges of the floor,
      the field weakness and may end abruptly - be careful

  - m_Id: 641535422464
    m_Localized: These panels control the elements of the system and the quasi-fields
      through which you move. We must try to turn off the lasers and infected transmitters
      of information to get to the exit
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 693674815488
    m_Localized: The panel will not keep you waiting. Less talk, more pain, marshmallow
      boy!

  - m_Id: 713539039232
    m_Localized: Apparently, we will have to go over the edge of the system in a
      quasi field. It's less safe this way, but there's no need to mess with the
      laser system.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 726692376576
    m_Localized: The panel has activated a quasi-field, through which you can get
      to the portal, hurry up!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 735953399808
    m_Localized: It seems to me that these portals will lead us to the exit
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 744073572352
    m_Localized: With the lasers and some virus transmitters turned off, you also
      turned off the quasi field, which was the source of energy for the antivirus

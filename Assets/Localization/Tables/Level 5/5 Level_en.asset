    m_Localized: We are in one of the sources of infection. In this place, the system
      is infected by 90%, so infected personnel can be unpredictable. There are a
      lot more infected robots here, and they are also much faster - be careful!

    m_Localized: I don't recommend using these portals. I think it would be faster
      if you just go down to the very bottom, slipping through those waves (And why
      does the Author give such hints...).

    m_Localized: The power of your anti-virus wave isn't enough to do much damage
      to him, so I think he'll be back soon. Hurry up and leave this place
